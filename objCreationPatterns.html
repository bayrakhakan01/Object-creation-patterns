        // 1. option Factory Pattern
        //we created Factory function first
        let peopleFactory = function (name, age, state) {
            // we created temp object second
            let temp = {};
            // we attached factory parameters to our temp object as properties 
            temp.age = age;
            temp.name = name;
            temp.state = state;
            // then we created a function related to our temp object to process our properties
            temp.printPerson = function() {
                console.log('Factory: My name is ' + this.name + ', I am ' + this.age + ' years old, and I live in ' + this.state);
            };
            // and in the end we return out temp object as a factory function result
            return temp;
            
        }

        // so based on our main class, function, obj, etc. we created new objects as a person

        let person1 = peopleFactory('John', 23, 'CA');
        let person2 = peopleFactory('Anna', 26,'SC');
        // in the end we are able to use sub functions in side of of the our main factory.
        person1.printPerson()
        person2.printPerson()
