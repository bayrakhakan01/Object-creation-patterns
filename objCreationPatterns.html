        // 1. option Factory Pattern
        //we created Factory function first
        let peopleFactory = function (name, age, state) {
            // we created temp object second
            let temp = {};
            // we attached factory parameters to our temp object as properties 
            temp.age = age;
            temp.name = name;
            temp.state = state;
            // then we created a function related to our temp object to process our properties
            temp.printPerson = function() {
                console.log('Factory: My name is ' + this.name + ', I am ' + this.age + ' years old, and I live in ' + this.state);
            };
            // and in the end we return out temp object as a factory function result
            return temp;
            
        }

        // so based on our main class, function, obj, etc. we created new objects as a person

        let person1 = peopleFactory('John', 23, 'CA');
        let person2 = peopleFactory('Anna', 26,'SC');
        // in the end we are able to use sub functions in side of of the our main factory.
        person1.printPerson()
        person2.printPerson()
        
    // 2. option Constructor pattern (this method more like JAVA when you create a constructor)

        // we created Constructor object

        let peopleConstructor = function (name, age, state) {
            // instead of creating a temporary object we directly attached Constructor parameters to our main object as properties            this.name = name;
            // bear in mind functions are also OBJECT
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.state = state;

            this.printPerson = function () {
                console.log('Constructor: My name is ' + this.name + ', I am ' + this.age + ' years old, and I live in ' + this.state);
            };
        };

         // since we are not returning any object inside of Constructor obj we have to create another obj from Constructor obj by keyword's new

        let person3 = new peopleConstructor('John', 23, 'CA');
        let person4 = new peopleConstructor('Anna', 26,'SC');
        // in the end we are able to use sub functions in side of of the our main factory.
        person3.printPerson()
        person4.printPerson()
